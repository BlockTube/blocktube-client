/// @title [TESTNET] Blocktu.be user contract.

/* 

    Blocktube has two tokens:
    a/ The BTToken
    b/ The ClipToken

    A blocktube clip has a limited supply of tokens (cliptoken).
    The ClipTokens are created by depositing BTToken ('like').
    
    After a certain treshold is met (end of the minting / crowdsale), 
    the next BTTokens (likes) will be distributed amongst 
    the token holders, in relation to the amount 
    of ClipTokens they hold.
